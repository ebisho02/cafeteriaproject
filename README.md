Cafeteria Worker Data Visualization Project

by Elizabeth Bishop

pie_chart_individual.py reads in data from an Excel spreadsheet that contains 
data about cafeteria worker participation in various union campaigns. In the
example data given, for example, there is data indicating whether or not
each worker at a specific cafeteria particpated in one of two photo campaigns
or a button wearing campaign. The program then creates a visual that 
shows which workers participated, and whether workers with either a leader
or follower relationship to that worker participated. The visualziation hopes
to show which people need to be organized to participate in union organizing
in order for the largest percentage of workers to also particpate.
